To participate in the workshop, we request that you come with R and RStudio 
installed. <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is a programming 
language that specializes in statistical computing. It is a powerful tool for 
exploratory data analysis. To interact with R, we **strongly** recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive development 
environment (IDE).
