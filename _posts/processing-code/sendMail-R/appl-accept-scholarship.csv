Hello Leah,
Thank you for applying to the 2016 NEON #WorkWithData Institute! We are pleased to formally invite you to attend the institute which will take place June 20 - 25 June 2016 at NEON Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado.

CONGRATULATIONS on Your Scholarship!

Congratulations - you have been selected to receive a scholarship that will cover the full tuition cost ($900) of the workshop. Thus you will not be required to submit a payment. Please note that you will be responsible for your travel and meal costs & transportation to and from the CU dorms and NEON headquarters! 

Important: Please Confirm Your Institute Slot
This year we had almost 50 applications and  there is a waiting list to attend the event. To secure your spot and confirm your housing preferences for the summer institute, please:

1. Review the institute agenda to ensure that the content of the institute will meet your needs as a participant. Please note that the institute is geared towards those who are newer to remote sensing data so we will spend some time reviewing basic concepts on the first day associated with hyperspectral and lidar data.

2. Fill out a very brief survey below as soon as possible, but also no later than Wednesday April 6, 2016 confirming your attendance OR declining attendance to the event.
