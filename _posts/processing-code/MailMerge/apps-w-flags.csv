Parasites represent much of our planet’s biodiversity. They are integral components of linkage density in food webs and their presence or absence can alter ecosystem community structure or indicate the presence of environmental toxins in an ecosystem. Lifecycles of parasites can be used to infer the presence of other organisms or environmental conditions that are integral to the completion of a parasite’s lifecycle in a given region, thus providing a snapshot in time of potential ecosystem functionality and stability. The transmission of parasites with indirect lifecycles depends on food webs and can be tracked across trophic levels. As more species must use wildlife corridors due to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, it is important -especially from a wildlife conservation and public health perspective, to understand and monitor parasite and host interactions. Increased exposure of naive populations to parasites, increased parasite loads, and potential host transfer (or host switching) are all potential and concerning consequences of corridor use. As environmental changes increase, we must understand and monitor parasite-host complexes on a landscape scale to minimize wildlife and public health risks. /  / Parasite presence and load successfully incorporates the evolutionary and ecological context necessary for the development of large spatio-temporal responses to the expanding biodiversity crisis.
