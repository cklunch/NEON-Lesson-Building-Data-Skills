description: "This lesson demonstrates ways that scientists identify and use 
data that they use to study disturbance events. Further, it encourages students 
to think about why we need to quantify change and  different types of data 
needed to quantify the change.  This lesson focuses on flooding as a natural 
disturbance event with impacts on the local human populations. Specifically, it 
focuses on the causes and impacts of flooding that occurred in 2013 throughout 
Colorado with an emphasis on Boulder county."

## Flooding in Colorado

### Disturbance Events

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Definition:**  In ecology, a **disturbance event** is a temporary change in environmental conditions that causes a pronounced change in the ecosystem.  Common disturbance events include floods, fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis. 
{: .notice}

What caused the flooding and why was it more catastrophic than events following other storms?  

## Driver: Climatic & Atmospheric Patterns
## Drought
How do we measure drought? 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Definition:**  The **Palmer Drought Severity Index** is XXX
{: .notice}

The Palmer Drought Severity Index is a measure of soil moisture content.  It is calculated from soil available water content,precipitation and temperature data.  The values range from **extreme drought** (values <-4.0) through **near normal** (-.49 to .49) to **extremely moist** (>4.0).

Bonus: There are several other commonly used drought indices.  The 
<a href="http://drought.unl.edu/Planning/Monitoring/ComparisonofIndicesIntro" target="_blank">
National Drought Mitigation Center </a> 
provides a comparison of the different indices.  

This figure shows the Palmer Drought Severity Index from 1990 to 2015 for Colorado. 

What are the patterns of drought within Colorado that you observe using this Palmer Drought Severity Index?

Over this decade and a half, there have been several cycles of dry and wet periods.  The 2013 flooding occurred right at the end of a severe drought. 

There is a connection between the dry soils during a drought and the potential for flooding.  In a severe drought the top layers of the soil dry out.  Organic matter, spongy and absorbent in moist topsoil, may dessicate and be transported by the winds to other areas. Some soil types, like clay, can dry to a near-impermeable brick causing water to flow across the top instead of sinking into the soils.  

In this interactive plot we can zoom in to see that the Colorado July 2013 Palmer Drought Severity Index value was -5.3.  In the month leading up to the flood, the Index climbed to 1.7, well into the category of Slightly Wet (1 to 1.9).

### Atmospheric Conditions
In September 2013, a slow moving cold front moved through Colorado intersecting
with a warm, humid front. The clash between the cold and warm fronts yielded 
heavy rain and devastating flooding across the Front Range in Colorado.

The storm that caused the 2013 Colorado flooding was kept in a confined area over the Eastern Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado by these water vapor systems. 

## Driver: Precipitation

GRAPHIC: Century or multi-decade rainfall patterns
Text: something about pattern of rainfall?


This plot shows daily precipitation between August 15 - October 15 2015. 

Explore the data and answer the following questions:

1. What dates were the highest precipitation values observed? 
2. What was the total precipitation on these days? 
3. In what units is this value?

## Driver: Stream Discharge

**some background on stream discharge will go here..**

Below, have a look at a static plot that shows stream discharge in Boulder Creek
for 2013. What do you notice about the patterns of discharge seen in these data?

## Impact: Flood

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Definition:**  A **flood** is anytime water inundates normally dry land.  
{: .notice}

```{r map-boulder-floodplain, echo=FALSE}
#embedded leaflet map of the boulder floodplain
#{% include /maps/_boulderFloodplain.html %}
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Definition:**  A **flood plain** is land adjacent to a waterway, from the channel banks to the base of the enclosing valley walls, that experiences flooding during periods of high discharge.  
{: .notice}

### Return Interval
100-year/500-year Flood Headline images

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Definition:**  A **return interval ** is the likelihood, a statistical measurement, of how often an event will occur for a given area.

## Impact: Erosion & Sedimentation

### Measuring the Change
 How do we measure Erosion & Sedimentation as it changes the terrain?

#### Survey

#### Stereoscopy - before after images. 

#### LiDAR

### Advantages of Quantifying Change
What does the data – quantifying the drivers/impacts – give us, that simply viewing the photos or video footage of the event do not?
