##Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need the most current version of `R` and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded
on your computer to complete this tutorial.

###Install R Packages
* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

###Download Data 
(include file that inserts a button to download data from Figshare & text about
data.  Feel free to just add text until the data set is finalized and uploaded).

Final Plot - combo of two plots stacked (e.g. not 2 y-axes on 1 plot)
Plot 1
x-axis: time, day of year
y-axis: proportion of individuals in phenophase of interest or mean % leaves
Time 
	Maybe: choose breaking leaf buds, leaves, colored leaves
Plot 2
y-axis: daily max temperature
(Maybe repeat this with multiple sites)

Science Concepts: 
Correlations between them, 
Transition periods - these are the ones to zoom in on.  

### Format Dates in Axis Labels
We can adjust the date display format (e.g. 2009-07 vs. Jul 09) and the number 
of major and minor ticks for axis date values using `scale_x_date`. Let's
format the axis ticks so they read "month year" (`%b %y`). To do this, we will 
use the syntax:

`scale_x_date(labels=date_format("%b %y")`

Rather than re-coding the entire plot, we can add the `scale_x_date` element
to the plot object `AirTempDaily` that we just created. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can type `?strptime` into the `R` 
console to find a list of date format conversion specifications (e.g. %b = month).
Type `scale_x_date` for a list of parameters that allow you to format dates 
on the x-axis.
{: .notice }

```{r format-x-axis-labels }
# format x-axis: dates
AirTempDailyb <- AirTempDaily + 
  (scale_x_date(labels=date_format("%b %y")))

AirTempDailyb
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If you are working with a date & time
class (e.g. POSIXct), you can use `scale_x_datetime` instead of `scale_x_date`.
{: .notice }



### Export data.frame to .CSV

We can export this subset in `.csv` format to use in other analyses or to 
share with colleagues using `write.csv`. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Remember, to give your output files
concise, yet descriptive names so you can identify what it contains in the
future. By default, the `.csv` file will be written to your working directory. 
{: .notice}

``` {r write-csv}
# write harMet15 subset data to .csv
write.csv(harMet15.09.11, 
          file="Met_HARV_15min_2009_2011.csv")

```
