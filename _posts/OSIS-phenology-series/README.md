# Welcome to the NEON Data Skills Lesson Building Repo!
# OS/IS Understanding Phenology and Temperature Tutorial Series


## Data 
Until the complete teaching data subset is complete the data for these lessons
are store in house: N:\Common\TOS\OSIS_dataLessons
Once the tutorials are complete and the data subsets are ready for publication 
they will be available for download within each tutorial. 

## Processing code
Please add code built to process any of the data (but not used in the lessons)
in the processing code directory so that we all have access to the code & don't
end up loosing it.  The code may be the basis for future tutorials.
