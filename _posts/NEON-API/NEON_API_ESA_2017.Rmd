## About
This is a lesson in pulling data from the NEON API, using base R 
and the R package httr. There are 3 basic categories of NEON data:

1. Observational - Data collected by a human in the field, or in an analytical laboratory, e.g. beetle identification, foliar isotopes
1. Instrumentation - Data collected by an automated, streaming sensor, e.g. net radiation, soil carbon dioxide
1. Remote sensing - Data collected by the airborne observation platform, e.g. LIDAR, surface reflectance

This lesson covers the first two types of data. NEON remote sensing data are not currently available through the API.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.
**API Skill Level:** Beginner - you have little to no experience with APIs.

# Goals / Objectives
After completing this activity, you will:

* Be able to pull observational, instrumentation, and geolocation data from the NEON API.
* Be able to transform API-accessed data from JSON to tabular format for analyses.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

* **httr:** `install.packages("httr")`
* **devtools:** `install.packages("devtools")`
* **neonDataStackR:** `devtools::install_github("NEONScience/NEON-utilities/neonDataStackR")`

### Additional Resources

* [Website for the NEON API](http://data.neonscience.org/data-api)
* [GitHub repository for the NEON API](https://github.com/NEONScience/neon-data-api)

## Anatomy of an API call
### Base URL: 
Specifics are appended to this in order to get the data or 
metadata you're looking for, but all calls to this API will include 
the base URL. For the NEON API, this is http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0

### Endpoints: 
What type of data or metadata are you looking for?

~/products
  Information about one or all of NEON's data products

~/sites
  Information about data availability at the site specified in the call

~/locations
  Spatial data for the NEON locations specified in the call

~/data
  Data! By product, site, and date (in monthly chunks).

### Targets:
The specific product, site, or location you want to get data for.


## Observational data
Which product do you want to get data for? Consult the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog" target="_blank">data product catalog</a>.

We'll pick Soil stable isotopes (Distributed periodic), DP1.10100.001
First query the API to find out which sites and dates have data available:

``` {r os-avail-query}

library(httr)
req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.10100.001")
req

```
