## About
This is a lesson in pulling data from the NEON API, using base R and the R package httr. There are 3 basic categories of NEON data:

1. Observational - Data collected by a human in the field, or in an analytical laboratory, e.g. beetle identification, foliar isotopes
1. Instrumentation - Data collected by an automated, streaming sensor, e.g. net radiation, soil carbon dioxide
1. Remote sensing - Data collected by the airborne observation platform, e.g. LIDAR, surface reflectance

This lesson covers the first two types of data. NEON remote sensing data are not currently available through the API.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

# Goals / Objectives
After completing this activity, you will:

* Be able to pull observational, instrumentation, and geolocation data from the NEON API.
* Be able to transform API-accessed data from JSON to tabular format for analyses.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

* **httr:** `install.packages("httr")`
* **devtools:** `install.packages("devtools")`
* **neonDataStackR:** `devtools::install_github("NEONScience/NEON-utilities/neonDataStackR")`

### Additional Resources

* [Website for the NEON API](http://data.neonscience.org/data-api)
* [GitHub repository for the NEON API](https://github.com/NEONScience/neon-data-api)
