# NEON Data Skills Lesson Building Repository
This is a development repository for the
<a href="http://www.neondataskills.org" target="_blank">NEON Data Skills portal</a>. 
Here the NEON Data Skills team & collaborators develops and builds new content. 
Content is transferred to the NEONInc/NEON-Data-Skills repository to be published. 

## How to Collaborate

If you are invited to help build lessons in this repo, you will find a folder
in the `_posts` directory that will contain (nearly) all of the files associated
with the lessons you are working on. This subdirectory will contain both the 
"raw" code files (.Rmd, .py, .ipynb, etc) and the .md pages from which the website
is built.  For a .md page to render with Jekyll it must start with a date (see 
other subdirectories for examples if need be). The other two directories that 
you may use are: 

* `images`: each series/lesson will have a subdirectory with the same naming/file
path as in the `_posts` directory. This allows for organized and automated 
creation of files.  
* `code`: this directory (same file paths inside) will contain any code that 
should be downloadable with the lesson via the "Download code" button at the 
bottom of each tutorial page. 

While lesson building, you can also build the website locally to see how things look.
